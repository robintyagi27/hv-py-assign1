#  Auto Configuration Management Parser  
A simple DevOps-friendly Python application that automatically:

✔ Reads a configuration file (`config.ini`)  
✔ Parses key–value pairs  
✔ Stores the parsed data as JSON (`config_output.json`)  
✔ Provides a REST API (`GET /config`) to fetch the stored configuration  
✔ Performs graceful error handling  

This project demonstrates core DevOps automation concepts including configuration parsing, structured output, and API-based retrieval.

##  Features

- Parse configuration in **INI format**
- Extract values based on section (e.g., `[Database]`, `[Server]`)
- Store final output as **JSON**
- Expose GET endpoint to retrieve stored configuration
- Handles missing files and read errors gracefully
- Lightweight Flask API

##  Sample Input File (config.ini)



[Database]
host = localhost
port = 3306
username = admin
password = secret

[Server]
address = 192.168.0.1
port = 8080


---

##  How It Works

1. When you run the application:  
   ```bash
   python app.py


The program reads config.ini

Extracts each section and its key-value pairs

Converts data into a Python dictionary

Saves the results as JSON into config_output.json

A Flask API is started on port 5000

The endpoint GET /config returns stored JSON

 Error Handling

If config.ini is missing → error printed

If file is unreadable → descriptive error

If JSON output missing → API returns 404 with message

 Running the Application
1. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the App
python app.py

3. Access API

 Open your browser:

http://localhost:5000/config

 Sample API Response
{
    "Database": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": "3306",
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "secret"
    },
    "Server": {
        "address": "192.168.0.1",
        "port": "8080"
    }
}

 config_output.json (Generated Output)
{
    "Database": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": "3306",
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "secret"
    },
    "Server": {
        "address": "192.168.0.1",
        "port": "8080"
    }
}
